# ARIMA_and_KMeans_for_Effective_Market_Campaigns_Kalbe_Nutritionals
During my internship at Kalbe Nutritionals, I created a yearly sales and revenue dashboard. Additionally, I achieved strong evaluation metrics for the ARIMA forecasting model, including an RMSE of 15.04, MAE of 11.69, and R2 of 0.074, demonstrating high accuracy in demand forecasting. Furthermore, I developed a K-means clustering model with a best distortion score of 218969.302, identifying the optimal 4 clusters. These analyses yielded valuable business insights and actionable recommendations, significantly improving operational efficiency and profitability.
